SpaceSteak Sun Jun 1 19:36:46 2014 1. The page "assignment1" dynamically generates a table based what the sql query returns. Very nice work, Geoff. :) * The table's content is generated from getUsers in the controller, assignment1.php, which sends its data to the view * The view is driven by assignment1_view.php which loads a few side templates which we will use for the other assignments. Inline image 1 2. The SQL query is in getUsers() and is a simple unsecure pure sql. Thomas, this is where you can basically plop your queries to have them printed in assignment1. If you want to get fancy, you could setup a button on assignment1 that allows you to select which query to run instead of manually changing the SQL queries.
